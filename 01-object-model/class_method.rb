# Objects are created from classes. Anything in Ruby that is said to have a value is an object (ex: numbers, strings, arrays, classes, modules)

# Methods, blocks, and variables are not objects

# prints 'String'
puts "hello".class

# prints 'Integer'
puts 7.class

# prints 'Array'
puts ["A", "B", 1].class
